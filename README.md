# CS:GO - Scripting Framework

*this project is currently under development, there is no official release yet.*

CF:GO is as scripting framework for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO).

It's completely based on config files (`.cfg`) and has no additional dependencies. Therefor it is compatible with the vanilla game and **won't cause issues** with the Valve Anti-Cheat System (VAC).

Although it's specifically intented for CS:GO, it can also work with other games that are based on the source engine and allow the use of `.cfg` files. However there may be differences in the functions supported by the game which could lead to the framework or parts of it not working as intended.


## Maintenance & Contributing

This is a spare time project of mine, so the time I invest in it may vary. You are welcome to open issues, post suggestions or submit pull requests.

The development branch might be subject to breaking changes, keep that in mind when working with this framework. I will try to merge to master and release a new version if new features or fixes were introduced.
